## Overview

Vista is a minimalist PHP view engine that focuses on performance and simplicity. It provides powerful tools to manage layouts, partials/includes, and dynamic content rendering, making it an ideal choice for modern PHP projects. Unlike traditional template engines like Blade or Twig, Vista does not rely on compiling or caching template files. This makes it an ideal choice for developers who prioritize performance and need a straightforward solution for managing views.

## Key Features

Vista is only five files and very capable:

- **No Compilation Required**: Renders views directly which makes debugging simple.
- **Lightning Fast**: Optimized for speed, with minimal overhead.
- **Extremely Lightweight**: Small footprint, easy to integrate with any PHP application.
- **Modern Syntax**: Intuitive, clean, and developer-friendly APIs.
- **Layout Management**: Easily create reusable layouts and templates.
- **Partial Rendering**: Modularize your views with include and section methods.
- **Scoped Data Passing**: Pass variables to views with isolated scopes for security and clarity.
- **Extensible**: Works seamlessly with other PHP frameworks or custom solutions.
- **Sanitize**: Sanitize raw HTML, attributes, and JSON.
